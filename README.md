Purpose (dashboard to represent qual and quant responses, including demographic info, title/salary info, and subjective rating responses. A 'first look' visualization that could then lead to further roads of inquiry.)

Tasks (clean data using powerbi, including ex ex, build visuals) 

## Results:

## Summary:

High level: demographic info (age, sex, location), satisfaction ratings, title/salary info

### Recommendations:
* clean using Python to more meaningfully clean and group 'other' options, especially ethnicity/race, country, job title, favorite programming language 
* create more advanced filters/drill down elements using demographics to meaningfully compare across country
