# Power BI Survey

## Overview of the Analysis:

Context:
* This data was collected by Alex Freberg via a survey of 630 respondents from the audience of his data analytics educational content. 

Purpose:
* Create a dashboard for 'first look', high level visualizations of the respondent data, including demographic information, job titles, salary, and qualitative satistifaction responses. This data cleaning and visualizing was done to hone and demonstrate my use of PowerBI. 

Tasks:
* Clean the data in PowerBI, including simplifying and binning all 'other'responses as well as transforming categorical salary responses to numerical data types for further aggregation.
* Build high level summary visualizations in PowerBI.

## Results:

### Dashboard 


### Fields


### Country Filters

## Summary:

Many insights depending on focus (list 3)

High level: demographic info (age, sex, location), satisfaction ratings, title/salary info 

Filter: by country

### Recommendations:
* clean using Python to more meaningfully clean and group 'other' options, especially ethnicity/race, country, job title, favorite programming language 
* create more advanced filters/drill down elements using demographics to meaningfully compare across country 
* data sampling limitations: titles, countries not equally represented so hard to draw meaningful comparisons (i.e. 380 data analysts and  3 data architects, 260 U.S. and 73 India)
